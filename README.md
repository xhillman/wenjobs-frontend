#### Vision
------

What is the vision of this product?

-   To create a more effective, efficient and natural path for job seekers to identify and obtain their next role.

What pain point does this project solve?

-   Job boards are great at percolating a vast array of jobs in one place, but are disconnected from your network and from each other. LinkedIn is a great resource for networking, but you have to have a specific job or company in mind in order to see who might be in your network. Lastly, researching companies and identifying a decent volume of meaningful opportunities in your particular area of interest is just unsolved currently.

Why should we care about your product?

-   One of the hardest parts of the job hunt is networking---finding those people who can actually help you get your application seen and your voice heard. Often these quick conversations can lead to a job much more efficiently and effectively than any other job-seeking technique.
